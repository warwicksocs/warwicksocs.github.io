  <h2> What is a society? </h2>

  <p>
    Societies at university are a diverse collection of groups and organisations
    ranging from sports teams to hobby organisations to political groups.
  </p>

  <h2> Why join societies? </h2>

  <p>
    The obvious benefit of joining a student society is the impact it will have
    on your social life. You will meet people who share an interest with you, and
    you will widen your social network beyond your course and the people you live
    with. However, there are also real gains in terms of your employability - the 
    skills, qualities and knowledge you offer to prospective employers, which
    suggest that you will successfully adapt to life as a graduate in the workplace.
